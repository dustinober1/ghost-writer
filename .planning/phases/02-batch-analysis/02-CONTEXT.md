# Phase 2: Batch Analysis - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-19
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The flow starts with a bulk upload experience where I can drag in a folder or ZIP and let the system process everything. Once processing finishes, I want to land on a calm, high-level dashboard that gives me the big picture fast.

From that overview, I can drill into clusters, outliers, and individual documents without feeling overwhelmed. It should make large batches understandable and navigable right away.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Clarity at scale** - The batch experience makes large document sets easy to understand quickly
- **Overview-first results** - A strong summary dashboard that orients me before I drill down

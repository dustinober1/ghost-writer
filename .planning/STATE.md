Plan: 1 of 4 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2025-01-19 — Completed plan 01-01 (Per-Sentence Confidence Scoring)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░░] 25% (1/4 plans complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 10 minutes
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Explainability | 1 | 4 | 10 minutes |
| 2. Batch Analysis | 0 | TBD | - |
| 3. Enterprise API | 0 | TBD | - |
| 4. Multi-Model Ensemble | 0 | TBD | - |
| 5. Enhanced Fingerprinting | 0 | TBD | - |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

**From Plan 01-01 (Per-Sentence Confidence Scoring):**
1. **Three-tier confidence thresholds** (HIGH >0.7, MEDIUM 0.4-0.7, LOW <0.4) - Balances sensitivity and specificity while providing intuitive semantic categories
2. **Additive visual indicators** (badge overlays) - Preserves existing gradient background while adding discrete categorization
3. **No modification to AI probability calculation** - Confidence categorization added as separate layer, maintaining existing detection logic integrity
